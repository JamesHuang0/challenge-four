# Code Quiz

## Purpose

For this project I created a quiz that asked the user 6 questions with a time limit. The user has a total of 60 seconds to take the quiz. Everytime they answered a question incorrectly, ten seconds would be deducted from their time. At the end of the quiz, the remaining time would be their score, which they could save to the high score leaderboard with their name.
